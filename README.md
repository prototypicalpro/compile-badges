This action converts README badges into local copies in the repository. The goal of this action is to reduce bandwidth usage of shields.io for badge-heavy GitHub profile READMEs such as [this one](https://github.com/prototypicalpro/prototypicalpro).

## Usage

You can use `<!-- badge-compile -->` and `<!-- badge-compile-stop -->` tags to indicate which badges should be compiled in your `README`:
```markdown
...
<!-- badge-compile -->
![a badge](https://my-badge.com)
[![another badge with a link](https://my-other-badge.com)](https://my-project.com)
<!-- badge-compile-stop -->
...
```
Once these tags are in place, add the following workflow file to your `.github/workflows` folder:
```yaml

name: 'Compile Badges'

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  repolinter-action:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Compile Badges
        uses: prototypicalpro/compile-badges@v1
        with:
          input_markdown_file: README.md
          output_markdown_file: README-compiled.md
          cdn: true
      - name: Push To Master
        uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4
        with:
          commit_message: Compile README [skip ci]
          file_pattern: README-compiled.md readme/*

```
This workflow will then download and save each badge to a `readme` folder in the current repository. Once this is complete, the action will replace the badge URLs in the README with ones pointing to githack.com. Finally, this workflow will use [stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action) to commit the new markdown file and downloaded badges to the current branch. Note that this action only modifies the local filesystem, and it is up to the workflow creator to ensure the changes end up in source control.

 The final result is a `README-compiled.md` file that looks like so:
```markdown
...
<!-- badge-compile -->
![a badge](https://rawcdn.githack.com/<user>/<repo>/<branch>/readme/badge-0.svg)
[![another badge with a link](https://rawcdn.githack.com/<user>/<repo>/<branch>/readme/badge-1.svg)](https://my-project.com)
<!-- badge-compile-stop -->
...
```
And you're all set!

## Configuration

This action takes the following inputs:
```yaml
- uses: prototypicalpro/compile-badges-action@v1
  with:
    # The markdown file to load and parse for badges.
    #
    # Default: README.md
    input_markdown_file: ''

    # The markdown file to write when parsing and replacing is complete.
    #
    # Default: README.md
    output_markdown_file: ''

    # The directory to write all the fetched badge images to. Due to how
    # the content URLs are generated, this path must be relative and
    # contained in the current repository.
    #
    # Default: readme
    output_image_dir: ''

    # The current repository in owner/name format. This value is used to
    # generate URLs to raw.githack.com from a relative path in
    # the repository. It is recommended this be left as the default value.
    #
    # Default: ${{ github.repository }}
    output_image_dir: ''

    # The current branch/ref in github.ref format. This value is used to
    # generate URLs to raw.githack.com from a relative path in
    # the repository. It is recommended this be left as the default value.
    #
    # Default: ${{ github.ref }}
    current_branch: ''

    # Use githack's CloudFlare CDN for caching of provided badges.
    # This might cause delays and changes are not immediately visible.
    # The generated URLs will contain rawcdn.githack.com as source domain.
    cdn: false
```

## Example

This action is used to compile badges on my personal [GitHub profile README](https://github.com/prototypicalpro/prototypicalpro).
